CFG node
- list of pointers to other nodes (self-point allowed)
- list of ASTNodes

SymbolTable (but for CFG nodes)

Create new CFG for each macro

1. iterate through label children (ASTNodes)
2. jump instruction?
    yes: already in SymbolTable?
	yes: add pointer to that entry
	no: create new CFG node and add to symbol table
	    - associate with label of the jump instruction
	    - add pointer to newly-created CFG node
    no: add to current node and continue
